## Dog Breed Classifier Project
This repository contains all of the files submitted by me for the CNN project of Term 2 of Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree.

This project helped me learn the implementation of **CNNs** and using **Transfer Learning** to improve the performance of a network. I learned how to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Provided an image, the algorithm will try to detect if a dog is present in the image. If a dog is detected, the algorithm will use a CNN based on the Xception architecture and trained using weights from ImageNet database to predict the breed of the dog present. There are 133 different breeds of dogs that can be classified using this network. I got to explore other state-of-the-art CNN models such as ResNet50, VGG16, and InceptionV3 before choosing the Xception model after it showed greater accuracy on the test set.
